This project improves parking space detection using computer vision. It processes real-time images, converts RGB to grayscale, and applies calibration to identify available spots. With 99.5% accuracy, performance may drop in low light or overlapping vehicles. Future updates include an online system for pre-registered users to reserve spots.
